# Recycling Machine System

The Recycling Machine System provides a complete solution for automated item return and operational management. The system allows a Customer to Return Items, after which the system will Identify Items and Record Quantity before generating a Generate Receipt. For operators, the system facilitates managing the machine's state, including the ability for an Operator to Update Price and view a Report on returned items. The system also includes essential error handling, where issues like Item Stuck, Machine Full, or Receipt Roll Finished all extend to a Problem state, which ultimately triggers an Alarm for resolution, alongside Transaction Recording and visibility into Machine Status. This architecture ensures a smooth user experience while maintaining robust operational control.
